# You are given an array arr[] of non-negative numbers. Each number tells you
# the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from that position.
# For example:
# • If arr[i] = 3, you can jump to index i + 1, i + 2, or i + 3 from position i.
# • If arr[i] = 0, you cannot jump forward from that position.
# Your task is to find the minimum number of jumps needed to move from
# the first position in the array to the last position.
# Note: Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.
# Examples :
# Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: First jump from 1st element to 2nd element with value 3. From here
# we jump to 5th element with value 9, and from here we will jump to the last.
